#+TITLE: EXWM-outer-gaps
#+Author: Lucas Gruss

* Introduction

 A lot of window managers provide a feature called "gaps". It is useless, it is
 pretty but most importantly *it is a feature*. And therefore Emacs must have
 it. Sorry, I don't make the rules.

 This package provides a minor mode to have outer gaps around the workspaces,
 and some utility functions to control them.

 It's my first elisp package, and I wanted to try my hand at something
 rather easy. If the code sucks, don't hesitate to open an issue and tell me
 why (in fact, please do !).

* Installation

  I might go the extra mile and submit it to MELPA someday, but in the meantime
  I suggest using straight. I personally use Doom Emacs, which has its own
  package manager based on straight. I have the following in my configuration:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
;; in packages.el
(package! exwm-outer-gaps
  :recipe
  (:host github
   :repo "lucasgruss/exwm-outer-gaps"))

;; in config.el
(use-package exwm-outer-gaps
  :after (exwm xelb)
  :config
  (exwm-outer-gaps-mode +1))
  #+end_src

  I also bind =exwm-outer-gaps-mode= to a keybinding in order to easily toggle
  the mode and change dimensions of the gaps.

 #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
;; in your config for exwm, you can adapt exwm-input-global-keys
(setq exwm-input-global-keys
      `( ;; ...
        ([?\s-O]  . exwm-outer-gaps-mode)
        ([?\s-p]  . exwm-outer-gaps-increment)
        ([?\s-y]  . exwm-outer-gaps-decrement)
        ;; ...
        ))
 #+end_src

* How it works

  There is nothing to write home about, exwm comes with all the facility to
  implement this. For each exwm workspace (i.e. non-floating frame), there is a
  workarea that sets its geometry. Usually, each workarea takes up the whole
  screen/monitor but exwm provides =exwm-workspace--update-workareas-hooks= that
  we can use to add gaps.

  Since we only have control over the geometry of the frame, the gaps provided
  by this package are only "outer gaps", which means that "inner gaps" (gaps
  between emacs windows) is out of scope for this package. I do intend to write
  a package for inner gaps in the future by leveraging =window-divider-mode= and
  =xcb-shape= from =xelb=.

  Each side (left, right, top and bottom) has its own gap, so there is some
  level of granularity available.

  There are three user-facing functions that are =exwm-outer-gaps-increment=,
  =exwm-outer-gaps-decrement= and =exwm-outer-gaps-balance=, which respectively
  increment all four gaps at the same time, decrement all four gaps and balance all
  four gaps to be the same width (in case gaps where changed to not be all equal).
